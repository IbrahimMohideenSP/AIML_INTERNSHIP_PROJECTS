# Iris_flower-classification-
AI/ML

This project is part of my AI & ML Internship at NSP Nexus - Week 1 Task.

## Overview
Classifies iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Based on petal and sepal length and width.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed
1. Load dataset
2. Explore and visualize data
3. Preprocess (split into train/test)
4. Train model using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5. Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
6. Optional: Visualize results and try Decision Tree

## How to Run
Open the `Iris_Classification_Notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run cells one by one.
